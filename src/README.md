# Use Case Scoring Hub - Authentication

## Authentication Flow

This application uses a simple authentication flow for demonstration purposes:

1. Users navigate to `/login` to access the login form
2. They enter their credentials (email and password)
3. If valid, they're redirected to the main application
4. Protected routes require authentication to access
5. Users can log out which clears their session

## Test Credentials

For testing purposes, you can use these credentials:

- Email: `hello@datasciencelab.nl`
- Password: `Demo123`

## Implementation Notes

- The current implementation uses localStorage for session persistence
- In a production environment, replace the mock authentication with a secure backend service
- Consider implementing token refresh logic for improved security
- Add additional security measures like rate limiting for login attempts

## Future Improvements

- Add multi-factor authentication
- Implement proper session timeout
- Add account recovery flows
- Add role-based access control
